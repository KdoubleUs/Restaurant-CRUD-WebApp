        Growing up in NYC, the diversity and sheer variety of places can
        overwhelm many people when deciding where to go in the city that does
        not sleep. To a local resident it can be time-consuming and to a
        foreigner, overwhelming. Our application "whereTo" was designed to
        provide busy locals and foreigners alike: a carefully curated list of
        the top spots to visit in New York City. These designations were
        individually chosen and have been experienced first-hand. We'd also love
        for you to share your favorite spots with us as well, so we've
        incorporated a feature for you to submit them. We hope the journey to
        your next destination in New York will be less stressful. Let there be
        less time spent deciding and more time spent enjoying the best that New
        York City has to offer. whereTo?
